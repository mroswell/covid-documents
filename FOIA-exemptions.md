The Vaughn Index is directly tied to FOIA exemptions - it's the mechanism agencies use to justify why specific documents fall under one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions. Here are those exemptions:

**The Nine FOIA Exemptions:**

**Exemption 1: Classified Information**
- Documents properly classified for national defense or foreign policy
- Must be classified under an Executive Order
- Common in military, intelligence, and diplomatic records

**Exemption 2: Internal Personnel Rules**
- Internal agency practices and procedures
- Covers administrative matters of little public interest
- Cannot be used to hide substantive agency actions

**Exemption 3: Information Exempt Under Other Statutes**
- Documents specifically protected by other federal laws
- Examples: tax records (IRC), CIA operational files, census data
- The other statute must explicitly require non-disclosure

**Exemption 4: Trade Secrets/Commercial Information**
- Confidential business information
- Trade secrets, financial data, commercial proposals
- Often invoked for contractor bids, proprietary formulas

**Exemption 5: Deliberative Process Privilege**
- Inter/intra-agency memos and letters
- Protects pre-decisional deliberations and policy discussions
- Most frequently litigated exemption
- Also covers attorney-client privilege and attorney work product

**Exemption 6: Personal Privacy**
- Personnel, medical, and similar files
- Disclosure would be "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy"
- Requires balancing privacy interest against public interest

**Exemption 7: Law Enforcement Records**
- Only applies to records compiled for law enforcement purposes
- Has six subparts (A-F) protecting:
  - Ongoing investigations (7A)
  - Fair trial rights (7B)
  - Personal privacy (7C)
  - Confidential sources (7D)
  - Law enforcement techniques (7E)
  - Physical safety (7F)

**Exemption 8: Financial Institution Information**
- Reports from agencies regulating financial institutions
- Protects bank examination reports, audit materials

**Exemption 9: Geological/Geophysical Information**
- Oil and gas well data
- Rarely used exemption

**How the Vaughn Index Works with Exemptions:**

For each withheld document, the Vaughn Index must:
1. **Identify** which exemption(s) apply
2. **Explain** why that specific document fits the exemption criteria
3. **Justify** why no portions can be segregated and released
4. **Demonstrate** that the agency applied the exemption narrowly

For example, if claiming Exemption 5 (deliberative process), the index must show:
- The document is pre-decisional (created before a final decision)
- It's deliberative (contains opinions, not just facts)
- Release would harm the agency's decision-making process

Courts use the Vaughn Index to determine whether the agency properly applied exemptions without conducting in camera (private) review of every document, making it a crucial tool in FOIA litigation.
