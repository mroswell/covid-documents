### Modules
In clinical trial submissions to regulatory authorities (like the FDA, EMA, or other agencies), the content is organized into a standardized format called the Common Technical Document (CTD). Here are the five modules:

**Module 1: Administrative Information and Prescribing Information**
- Region-specific administrative documents
- Application forms, cover letters
- Proposed labeling/prescribing information
- Patent information
- Field copy certifications
- This module varies by regulatory authority (not harmonized)

**Module 2: CTD Summaries**
- High-level overviews of the entire submission
- Contains:
  - CTD Table of Contents
  - CTD Introduction
  - Quality Overall Summary (QOS)
  - Nonclinical Overview and Summaries
  - Clinical Overview and Summaries
- Written by experts to provide regulators with a comprehensive summary

**Module 3: Quality (CMC - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls)**
- Drug substance information (active ingredient)
- Drug product information (finished formulation)
- Manufacturing processes and controls
- Specifications and analytical methods
- Stability data
- Container closure systems
- Essentially all pharmaceutical development and manufacturing information

**Module 4: Nonclinical Study Reports**
- Pharmacology studies (primary, secondary, safety)
- Pharmacokinetics (ADME - absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion)
- Toxicology studies (single dose, repeat dose, reproductive, carcinogenicity)
- All animal and laboratory studies
- Written and tabulated summaries of nonclinical data

**Module 5: Clinical Study Reports**
- All human clinical trial data
- Biopharmaceutic studies
- Pharmacokinetic studies in humans
- Pharmacodynamic studies
- Efficacy and safety studies (Phase 1, 2, 3)
- Post-marketing experience (if applicable)
